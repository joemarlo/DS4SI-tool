# Assignment One: Site selection
### Use data to select sites to recruit!
In this assignment pretend that you have been charged with evaluating the impact of a job training program. The target population is similar to the population targeted by the JTPA. However, the hypothetical program is more fully defined with a prescribed curriculum, activities, and requirements for participation. We’ll call this program the JPTA (Job Pretend Training Activity). Each site will evaluate the effectiveness of the program using a randomized experiment where treatment is assigned at the individual level. The overall goal is to choose sites to target for recruitment into the study and then recruit them.

The challenge is to balance the goals of the evaluators (and funders) with the probability that a site will actually agree to participate while also considering the site's cost. You will use the information in the accompanying dataset to decide which sites to approach.

### Considerations
We learned from your readings and from our two most recent guest speakers (Mike Weiss, Fred Doolittle) several of the considerations that are involved when selecting sites for a multi-site trial. For this assignment you will need to take into account the follow considerations:

1. Choosing sites that will represent a reasonable counterfactual  
2. Creating a representative sample from the population of interest (maximizing external validity)  
3. Targeting sites that are likely to accept the invitation 
4. Keeping costs under control  

### Additional information 
MDRC researchers have information on how likely a site is to accept an invitation to participate. Based on past research they believe it is directly related to their comfort level with the concept of randomization (also represented in the data based in an initial survey). Pr(accept invitation) = level of comfort.

From the population of sites provided, create a sample to approach to participate in the study in a way that accounts for the considerations above. There are trade-offs between satisfying each of these requirements, and it may be impossible to satisfy all of them. Therefore, you should focus on just a few and then defend your choices about which considerations to privilege.

### The objective
The goal is to recruit 100 sites to participate in the randomized control trial — so you probably want to approach more than 100.

Your final product will be a 2-3 page report in which you do the following: 

1. Describe your approach to choosing the sites 
2. Profile your intended sample with regard to the variables provided 
3. Report your overall cost of site recruitment and the expected number of sites (probability of recruitment times the number of sites approached) 
4. Explain and defend your choices with regard to each of the considerations (#1-4) above 

You will be graded on your ability to thoughtfully discuss these issues, the trade-offs between the issues, and how to implement a strategy that addresses your priorities.

### Suggested organizational structure of your report
- **1/2 page:** Overview of goals with regard to the considerations you are going to prioritize over others and why 
- **1/2 page to 1 page:** More detail (step-by-step) about how your sites were selected, tying the choices to the specific considerations
- **1-2 paragraphs:** Descriptives about the sample you would try to recruit. This should optimally be in the form of a table or (even better!) figure(s) as well as text describing the interesting features of the sample. Feel free to use the built-in tools to create visualizations of your sites
- **1 paragraph:** Short discussion of overall cost and how that fits with the goals laid out in (1) above
- **2-3 paragraphs:** Conclusion/discussion. A brief overview of your ability to achieve the goals you had laid out for yourself as well as frustrations or limitations with why it was difficult/impossible to achieve them all.
