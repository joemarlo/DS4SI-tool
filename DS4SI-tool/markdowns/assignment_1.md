# Assignment One: Site selection
### Use data to select sites to recruit!
In this assignment pretend that you have been charged with evaluating the impact of a New Green Deal jobs program. The target population is  workers whose professions are being mechanized (requiring fewer workers and more machines) or otherwise phased out due to technology. Participants who meet set requirements will be trained and certified in a new eco-friendly, sustainable career using comprehensive curricula. We’ll call this program the Pretend New Green Deal (PNGD). Each site will evaluate the effectiveness of the program using a randomized experiment where treatment is assigned, within site, at the individual level. The goal of this assignment is to choose sites to target for recruitment into the study.

The challenge is to balance the goals of the evaluators (and funders) with the probability that a site will actually agree to participate while also considering the site's cost. You will use the information in the accompanying dataset to decide which sites to approach.



### Considerations
In our readings and from our guest speakers (Mike Weiss, Fred Doolittle) we are learning about several of the considerations that are involved when selecting sites for a multi-site trial. For this assignment you will need to take into account the follow considerations:

1. Choosing sites that will represent a reasonable counterfactual  
2. Creating a representative sample from the population of interest (maximizing external validity)  
3. Targeting sites that are likely to accept the invitation  
4. Keeping costs under control (some sites are more costly to both recruit and include in the study than others due to, e.g., travel costs in getting to them or other logistical concerns, this is reflected in the accompanying data)


### Additional information 
The accompanying dataset includes information on how likely a site is to accept an invitation to participate. This is based on past research suggesting that likelihood of participating is directly related to sites’ comfort level with the concept of randomization and an initial survey measuring this comfort level. The level of comfort is equal to the probability that a site accepts the invitation. 

From the population of sites provided, create a sample of sites that you want to approach to participate in the study.  This sample should be chosen in a way that accounts for the considerations above. There are trade-offs between satisfying each of these requirements, and it may be impossible to satisfy all of them. Therefore, you should focus on just a few considerations and then defend your choices about which considerations you chose to privilege.


### The objective
The goal is to recruit 100 sites that are willing to participate in the randomized control trial.  Given that not all sites will accept the invitation, you probably want to approach more than 100.

Your final product will be a 1,000-1,200 word report in which you do the following:  

1. Describe your approach to choosing the sites  
2. Profile the population and the sample you intend to approach with regard to all the variables provided. Bonus points: also profile the expected sample of sites that will accept the invitation.  
3. Report your overall cost of site recruitment and the expected number of sites (probability of recruitment times the number of sites approached)  
4. Explain and defend your choices with regard to each of the considerations (#1-4) above  

You will be graded on your ability to thoughtfully discuss these issues, the trade-offs between the issues, and how to implement a strategy that addresses your priorities.


### Suggested organizational structure of your report
Please structure your report to include the following subsections, each with appropriate headings:  

- **1/2 page:** Overview of goals with regard to the considerations you are going to prioritize over others and why 
- **1/2 page to 1 page:** More detail (step-by-step) about how your sites were selected, tying the choices to the specific considerations
- **1-2 paragraphs:** Descriptives about the sample you would try to recruit. This should optimally be in the form of a table or (even better!) figure(s) as well as text describing the interesting features of the sample. Feel free to use the built-in tools to create visualizations of your sites
- **1 paragraph:** Short discussion of overall cost and how that fits with the goals laid out in (1) above
- **2-3 paragraphs:** Conclusion/discussion. A brief overview of your ability to achieve the goals you had laid out for yourself as well as frustrations or limitations with why it was difficult/impossible to achieve them all.  

### What to turn in
- The report
- The zip file downloaded from the tool on the ‘Results summary’ page. Without this you'll be unable to do Assignment Four so save it somewhere safe.
