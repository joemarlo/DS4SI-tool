# Welcome to the site selection and recruitment assignment tool
### Your assignments

You'll use this tool to complete assignments one, two, and four. First, for assignment one you'll need to explore the data and then select (hypothetical) sites to invite to participate in a randomized control trial. For assignment two, you'll write up talking points and create a hand-out or brief presentation for a meeting you will have with the key stakeholders of each site that you select to recruit. In this meeting, you will explain the benefits of randomization and recruit them to participate in the trial. For assignment four, you'll receive the results containing the sites that accepted the invitations to participate — influenced by how persuasive you were  — and, finally, you'll produce a reproducible analysis of the trial.

See each of the assignment tabs for more details.

### How to use this tool
The tool is broken into four parts to help guide you through the process. You'll have the ability to explore the data, create your sample, _send invitations_ to the hypothetical sites, and finally see the results of which sites _accepted the invitation_ to participate in the trial.

1. **Site attributes:** a 'playground' for exploring the data, understanding its definitions and finding underlying patterns.
2. **Site selection:** contains the methods to create your own sample of sites. Once you're finished with a given method you'll want to save your dataset using the button at the bottom of each page. You can later access these saved datasets on other method pages and for when you decide to _send the invitations_. Note that you do not have to use each method.
  - Filtering: exclude certain categorical data and set minimums/maximums for numerical data.
  - Sampling: create simple and stratified random samples.
  - Manual exclusions: exclude sites manually by their ID.
3. **Send invitations:** an overview of your selected sample. This marks the end of assignment one (and two).
4. **Results:** an overview of the sites that _accepted the invitations_ to the trial. Plotting tools are provided for exploring the final sample.

### Summary metrics
There's four main metrics that summarize your selected sample of sites:
- Total cost: the total cost of all the sites. This consists of both the `cost to approach site` for the sites you send invitations to and the `cost to run study` for the sites that accept the invitation to participate.
- Generalizability index: an estimate of how well your sample represents the population. Scaled between [0, 1]
- Causality index: an estimate of how the results of the trial conducted at the selected sites can be interpreted causally  
- Sample size: the number of sites

You will not be graded based on the metric scores, however you will be graded on how well you interpret and communicate how these metrics impact the results of the trial.

### Tips: 
- Use your desktop or laptop. The tool does work on mobile but the experience is not optimized
- Do not stay idle for more than 15 minutes. The tool will time-out and you may have to restart your selection process
- Download your data when prompted. This is required for the assignments and you will not be able to access it later due to the tool's inherent randomization. Feel free to use the data for further analyses and summarizations.
- Use the plots you create here in your report. You can download your custom plots under Advanced -> Download the plot. For any of the other plots, take screenshots.
- You can visualize your saved datasets by going back to the Data exploration page -> Advanced filters and then select your dataset.
