# Assignment Two: Randomization
Pretend that you have been charged with evaluating the impact of multi-media educational programming for 3-5 year-olds (content in the vein of Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers). This program involves screening an educational TV series (12 episodes, one per day, each viewed twice over the course of five weeks) during preschool classroom time. 

You have met with the program officers and suggested randomizing which classrooms receive access to the new content in order to assess the impact of the show. The program officers have concerns about randomization. The program officers are worried about the optics and ethics of only offering the program to half of their preschool classrooms (as opposed to having it in all classrooms or having teachers decide whether or not they choose to show the videos). 

Please write a two-page memo to the program officers explaining the following:
- The benefits of randomization in terms of assessing impact; and
- The justification of randomization from an ethical standpoint (one way to think about this might be to anticipate ethical/moral concerns they may have to randomization and address them directly, e.g., do we know that receiving the programming is a benefit compared with not receiving it?);

Please include any amendments to the research protocol that you think should or could be part of the design, if any.  As an example, in medical trials if harm is detected at early stages of the experiment or if the benefit early on appears to be sufficiently large, researchers will end trials early to either stop those assigned to treatment from continuing to receive a detrimental treatment or to provide a clearly beneficial treatment to everyone earlier than the initial evaluation timeline.   

This memo should be written in concise, easy-to-understand, non-scientific language that is accessible to practitioners with or without any statistical training. Words that you are not allowed to use include: bias, efficiency, gold standard, placebo, systematic. You can use words such as randomize and confounding only if you also use more colloquial language to explain them. Your resulting memo should be something that a family member of yours who works in a completely different field and has no experience with data science or program evaluation would easily be able to read and understand. 

One potential organizational structure for this assignment would be to address the two points above in term, spending one paragraph on the advantages of randomization over non-experimental designs and another 2-3 paragraphs (page and a half) addressing concerns, wherein you clearly and succinctly identify each concerns and address it in 3-4 sentences and then move on to the next. You may alter this as you see fit, but should make sure to be clear and concise. Oftentimes less is more (talking around a point that you are struggling with is as likely to end up with you saying something inaccurate, unintended, and confusing as it is to end up with you saying the ‘right’ thing somewhere in the ramble). If you need a long first draft to clarify your thinking, that is great, but please hand in only a succinct, clarified final copy. 

### Bonus Points:
There is also a debate as to what the control condition(s) should be in this design. Specifically, the question is whether the control classrooms should be shown a different video whose content is not aligned with the educational goals of the program video (e.g., a nature video of baby animals) or whether the control should be business as usual (whatever would be happening in the classroom anyway absent this intervention). What would you advocate for as the control condition(s) and why? What are the pros and cons of these two different control condition(s) in terms of what we are able to learn about the impact of the program? Please respond in one to two paragraphs.
