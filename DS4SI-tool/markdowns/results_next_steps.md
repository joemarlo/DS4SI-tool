### Next steps

1. Download your data. Note: it may take a second for it to download due to the size.
2. Explore your data further using the "Data exploration" page.
3. Follow the directions for Assignment Four to create your own reproducible analysis.

### What's in the downloaded zip?
- `individuals.csv`: the results of the study for the sites that accepted your invitation. Each site contains 100 individuals.  `Treatment` indicates if treatment was assigned to the individual. `Income` is their observed outcome (annual income (in thousands) one year later).
- `sampled_plots.png`: histograms of the sites that accepted. Identical to the Plots tab to the right.
- `sampled_v_population_plots.png`: histograms and densities of the sites that accepted, sites that were sent the invitation, and the population. Identical to the Sampled vs. population tab to the right.
- `sites.csv`: data on all 1,000 sites with flags identifying if you sent an invitation and if the site accepted the invitation.
- `summary.csv`: table identical to the Summary metrics and attributes tab to the right.
