# Assignment Four: Reproducibility

<br>

#### _Coming soon_

<!--
The goal of this assignment is to create an instructional manual for teaching other researchers commands in R or Stata. Your submission for this assignment should be an R Markdown or Stata file (+pdf) that includes code, descriptions, documentation of your process, and any other materials or information that could help teach others how to complete the following actions. The results of the code included in the manual should be easily reproduced when run by another researcher (classmate, instructor, etc.). 

### Assignment details
The assignment requires a mix of (reproducible) programming and communication skills. You are being asked to both present key descriptives and findings from the PNGD impact evaluation for which you selected and recruited sites in assignments one and two. These results should reflect the specific sites who consented to participate in the study given your choices and persuasiveness on the past assignments. You are also, as part of this project, in charge of training junior members of your team in some basic data cleaning, analysis, and visualization methods in either R or Stata. Toward this end, you need to produce an instructional manual to teach a junior member of your team how to perform the following tasks:  

1. Jump to the Results page using the dark purple button below. Upload your dataset that you downloaded in assignment one and enter your persuasion score from assignment two. Submit to get your final results of which sites accepted your invititation to participate in the study.
2. Examine the final results of the sites that accepted, and download your data.
3. Load the sites.csv dataset into R or Stata.  
4. Create a summary table or figure with descriptive statistics for all variables in the dataset. Make sure that the summaries are appropriate for the type of data being described (e.g. do not use a 5-number summary for a binary variable!).  
5. Provide a brief description of what the table/figure shows you.  
6. Assess the impact of the PNGD. Run at least two models for this and explain your choices (e.g., what covariates you are including). Write up a brief description of your findings.
7. Create a visualization that will be useful to understanding your sample population or the findings. Use the Data exploration page for ideas if you are struggling with brainstorming. [Note to student: you can use any command that you want as long as (a) it incorporates at least two variables and (b) you have never used it before.] Describe why you chose that command (how it
uses data to inform the mission of the organization) and how you implemented it. Examples of types of commands: visualizations (graphs, charts, plots), data sorting, missing data summaries, predictive models. Pie charts of any sort are not allowed!  
8. Bundle/format this as demonstrated by Vicky Steeves (for R) or Jennifer Hill (for Stata).  
9. Create a title for your manual that is appropriate given what you did, for instance “Manual for visualizing how the relationship between high school degree rate and unemployment varies by region.”

### What to turn in:  
For R users:  

1. PDF created by knitting R Markdown file  
2. R Markdown file and everything needed for me to run it to produce your PDF (including the .csv file)

For Stata users:  

1. A clean and readable do-file containing all of your code  
2. A 1-2 page PDF write-up of your process containing your final tables. Your write-up should also describe the results of each table in a clearly written paragraph  
3. An excel file with your table shell of your regression results (using putexcel)
