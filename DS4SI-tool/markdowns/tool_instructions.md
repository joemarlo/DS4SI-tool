# How to use this tool
## Overview
The tool is broken into four parts to help guide you through the site selection process. You'll have the ability to explore the data, create your sample, _send invitations_ to the hypothetical sites, and finally see the results of which sites _accepted the invitation_ to participate in the trial.

1. **Site attributes:** a 'playground' for exploring the data, understanding its definitions and finding underlying patterns
2. **Site selection:** contains the methods to create your own sample of the population of sites
  - Filtering: exlcude certain categorical data and set minimums/maximums for numerical data
  - Sampling: create simple and stratified random samples
  - Manual exclusions: exclude sites manually by their ID
3. **Send invitations:** an overview of your selected sample. You must _send the invitations_ to progress to the **Results** page
4. **Results:** an overivew of the sites that _accepted the invitations_ to the trial. Plotting tools are provided for exploring the final sample



## Summary metrics
There's four main metrics that summarize your selected sample of sites:
- Total cost: the total cost of all the sites
- Generalizability score: an estimation of how well your sample represents the population
  - For the interested reader: 
- Causality score: an estimation of how ...
- Sample size: the number of sites

## Tips: 
- Do not stay idle for more than 15 minutes. The tool will time-out and you may have to restart your selection process
