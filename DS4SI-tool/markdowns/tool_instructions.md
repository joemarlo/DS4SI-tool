# How to use this tool
## Overview
The tool is broken into four parts to help guide you through the process. You'll have the ability to explore the data, create your sample, _send invitations_ to the hypothetical sites, and finally see the results of which sites _accepted the invitation_ to participate in the trial.

1. **Site attributes:** a 'playground' for exploring the data, understanding its definitions and finding underlying patterns
2. **Site selection:** contains the methods to create your own sample of the population of sites. Once you're finished with a given method you'll want to save your dataset using the button at the bottom of each page. You can later access these saved datasets on other method pages and for when you decide to _send the invitations_. Note that you do not have to use each method.
  - Filtering: exclude certain categorical data and set minimums/maximums for numerical data
  - Sampling: create simple and stratified random samples
  - Manual exclusions: exclude sites manually by their ID
3. **Send invitations:** an overview of your selected sample. You must _send the invitations_ to progress to the **Results** page. Once the invitations are sent, you'll no longer be able to use the **Site attributes** or **Site selection** pages.
4. **Results:** an overview of the sites that _accepted the invitations_ to the trial. Plotting tools are provided for exploring the final sample



## Summary metrics
There's four main metrics that summarize your selected sample of sites:
- Total cost: the total cost of all the sites to participate in the trial
- Generalizability index: an estimate of how well your sample represents the population. Scaled between [0, 1]
- Causality index: an estimate of how the results of the trial conducted at the selected sites can be interpreted causally. Scaled between [0, 1]   
- Sample size: the number of sites

You will not be graded based on the metric scores, however it is important to be able to interpret and communicate how these metrics impact the results of the trial.

## Tips: 
- It's suggested to use your desktop or laptop. The tool does work on mobile but the experience is not optimized
- Do not stay idle for more than 15 minutes. The tool will time-out and you may have to restart your selection process
- On the **Results** page you'll be able to download the data. Feel free to use this to do further analyses and summarizations
- Use the plots you create here in your report. You can download your custom plots under Advanced -> Download the plot. For any of the other plots, take screenshots
- You can visualize your saved datasets by going back to the Data exploration page -> Advanced filters and then select your dataset
