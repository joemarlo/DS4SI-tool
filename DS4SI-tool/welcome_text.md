# Welcome to the site selection and recruitment assignment
### Use data to select sites to recruit!

<br>
In this assignment pretend that you have been charged with evaluating the impact of a job training program. The target population is similar to the population targeted by the JTPA. However the hypothetical program is more fully defined with a prescribed curriculum, activities, and requirements for participation. We’ll call this program the JPTA (Job Pretend Training Activity). Each site will evaluate the effectiveness of the program using a randomized experiment where treatment is assigned at the individual level. The overall goal is to choose sites to target for recruitment into the study and recruit them.

You will need to use the provided data to a subset of the sites that you will target for recruitment into the study. The challenge is to balance the goals of the evaluators (and funders) with the probability that a site will actually agree to participate as well as the cost. You will use the information in the accompanying dataset to make your decisions.

### Considerations
We learned from your readings and from our two most recent guest speakers (Mike Weiss, Fred Doolittle) several of the considerations that are involved when selecting sites for a multi-site trial. For this assignment you will need to take into account the follow considerations:

a) choosing sites that will represent a reasonable counterfactual,  
b) creating a representative sample from the population of interest (maximizing external validity),  
c) accommodating logistical challenges,  
d) targeting sites that are likely to accept the invitation, and  
e) keeping costs under control.  

Additional information. The cost for recruiting each site is a function of the distance from the nearest MDRC office, specifically cost in $ = 1000 + distance*500. (This distance (in hours) is captured in the “distance” variable in the dataset). MDRC researchers also have information on how likely a site is to accept an invitation to participate. Based on past research they believe it is directly related to their comfort level with the concept of randomization (also represented in the data based in an initial survey). Pr(accept invitation) = level of comfort. [Note that level of comfort is on a scale from 0 to 1].

The (simulated) data for this assignment are available in this folder. The dataset represents the population of sites that are currently implementing the job training program. See the separate “data dictionary” for more information on all variables. From the population of sites provided, choose a sample to approach to participate in the study in a way that take account of the considerations above. Note that there are trade-offs between satisfying each of these requirements and it’s very possible that is impossible to satisfy all of them. Therefore you should probably focus on just a few and then defend your choices so about which considerations to privilege.

The goal is to recruit 30 sites (so you probably want to approach more than 30).

Your final product will be a 2-3 page report in which you do the following.

1) Describe your approach to choosing the sites.  
2) Profile your intended sample with regard to the variables provided.  
3) Report your overall cost of site recruitment and the expected number of sites (probability of recruitment times the number of sites approached).  
4) Explain and defend your choices with regard to each of the considerations ((a)-(e)) above.  

You will be graded on your ability thoughtfully discuss these issues and the trade- offs between them and to implement a strategy that addresses your priorities.

### Suggested organizational structure
1) Overview of goals with regard to the considerations you are going to prioritize over others and why.  
2) More detail (step by step) about exactly how your sites were selected, tying the choices to the specific considerations. (1/2 page to a page)  
3) Descriptives about the sample you would try to recruit. This should optimally be in the form of a table or (even better!) figure(s) as well as text describing the interesting features of the sample. (1-2 paragraphs)  
4) Short discussion of overall cost and expected number of sites (one paragraph) and how that fits with the goals laid out in (1) above. (1 paragraph)  
5) Conclusion/discussion. A brief overview of your ability to achieve the goals you had laid out for yourself as well as frustrations or limitations with why it was difficult/impossible to achieve them all. (2-3 paras)
